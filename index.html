                    In my first challenge I was given functional HTML and CSS code, and was requested to modify it to meet 
                    accesability standards. I did this by adding alt attributes for images, and other tactics to increase accessability 
                    such as search engine optimization. I also redesigned the code to include more comments, follow sequential order, and 
                    utilize semantic HTML elements.
